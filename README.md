## Introduction

The **forensim** package implements methods for interpretation and simulation
of forensic DNA mixture. Version 4.3 of the package was archived from CRAN
on 2022-06-30. This repository is an import of the original SVN repository
at https://forensim.r-forge.r-project.org/ that is no longer updated. Here,
minor updates have been applied to make a version 4.3.3 that can be made
available on CRAN again. This is of interest because several published papers
make use of the package. No further development is planned.
